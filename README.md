# SSIR

This is our implementation for the paper:

"Shared-view and Specific-view Information Extraction for Recommendation"

If you use the codes, please cite our paper. Thanks!

# Requirements
Tensorflow 1.2-2.4

Python 2.7, 3.5-3.7

Numpy

Scipy

# Data Preparation
 
Our code is rewritten from PARL, so the data set is required to be similar to PARL. Details can be found at https://github.com/WHUIR/PARL. 

Our dataset is one more dataset than PARL:Item Auxiliary Review Document: file_name=ItemAuxiliaryReviews.out.

Note that: all files need to be located in the same directory

# To run the experiments:

python ssir.py
